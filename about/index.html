<p>Static sites are a great part of the small web. They are easy to configure, deploy, and maintain. You can use a static site generator or write the HTML yourself.</p>
<p>I've been in the static website realm for over 10 years and have used many platforms, and have always enjoyed seeing how this form of website building had changed over the years.</p>
<p>Static.Quest was a way to have a place for all of these awesome static websites share their design, content, and allow others to find them.</p>
<p>Web Rings have been around for a long time since the Internet was first created.</p>

<p>were a popular phenomenon in the early days of the internet, serving as a way for website owners to connect and promote their sites within a specific niche or theme. Essentially, a web ring was a collection of websites linked together, forming a circular chain. Each member of the ring would include a link to the previous and next site in the chain, creating a network of interconnected websites.</p>

<ul>
<li>Membership: Website owners would join a web ring by submitting their site's URL to the ring's curator.</li>
<li>Inclusion: The curator would then add the new site to the ring's list of members.</li>
<li>Link Exchange: Each member site would include links to the previous and next sites in the chain on their own website.</li>
<li>Promotion: As visitors navigated through the ring, they would discover new websites within their area of interest.</li>
</ul>
